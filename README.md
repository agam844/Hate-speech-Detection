# Hate-speech-Detection
The main objective of this project is to develop a model that can effectively detect whether a tweet contains hate speech or offensive language, or if it is neutral. To achieve this goal, the project utilized various classification techniques and compared their effectiveness in handling the given dataset. Finally, a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) classification model was used as it demonstrated superior performance in accurately identifying hate speech and offensive language in tweets. This model is expected to be useful for social media platforms to filter out harmful content and prevent cyberbullying, harassment, and discrimination.
Furthermore, the project utilized a dataset of nearly 10,000 tweets, which were first pre-processed to remove any irrelevant information and split into training, testing, and validation sets. The different classification techniques were then applied to these sets, and their performances were evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. After experimenting with various classifiers, the BERT end-to-end classifier was found to be the most effective, with an accuracy of 92% on the test data.
Additionally, in this project, various other classification techniques were explored and tested for their effectiveness in detecting hate speech and offensive language in tweets. These techniques included KMeans clustering, a dummy classifier with the most frequent class and stratified strategies, logistic regression with TF-IDF vectorization and one-hot encoding, SVD classification, logistic regression with TF-IDF vectorization and parameter tuning, decision tree classification, and BERT classification. By comparing the results obtained from each of these techniques, the project was able to identify the most effective approach for accurately detecting hate speech and offensive language in tweets. 
Overall, the project's findings are expected to have significant implications for improving social media content moderation and promoting a safer online environment.
